# OptChat recipe reference

The implementation was compared with the recipe fetched on 2026-10-04. The reference content SHA-256 was `8f6997e8944d85e4df53b5704bf7c4e393e4da361071181e9cc2f7d9d1b6e430`.

The source remains upstream rather than duplicating the full article here. Its four prompt strings are preserved in `src/prompts.ts`, with attribution in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

## Implementation mapping

- `src/memory.ts`: append-only log, binary summary tree, compression scheduling, bounded view, zoom/date.
- `src/compactor.ts`: contextual compression and size retries.
- `src/cache.ts`: stable Anthropic cache boundaries.
- `src/transcript.ts`: fresh context per parent run, current-run tool loop retained. The previous completed exchange is also retained in full text (left out if over 16,000 bytes by default), an intentional addition to the summary-only recipe for conversational continuity.
- `src/agents.ts`: asynchronous Pi SDK children and automatic completion reports.
- `src/settings.ts`: per-profile settings for the departures from the recipe. Defaults are the recipe's (one subagent level), except the previous exchange (on) and the summary size tolerance (640 bytes, against the recipe's strict 512).
- `src/import/`: profile-scoped historical imports retain user messages and final assistant replies, following the lighter history described in recipe section 10. An import hands `Memory` one message at a time, each once the one before it is summarized, so the compactor sees the view a live chat would have shown it. Source adapters, final-reply detection, replay filtering, and ChatGPT branch labels are integration choices. Live-chat tool logging remains unchanged.

Profiles, native Pi UI, conversation import, and local Git checkpoints are integration choices described in the README.
